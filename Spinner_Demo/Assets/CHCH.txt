Christ Church

Christchurch, known for its English heritage, is located on the east coast of New Zealand’s South Island. 
Flat-bottomed punts glide on the Avon River, which meanders through the city centre. 
On its banks are cycling paths, the green expanse of Hagley Park and Christchurch Botanic Gardens. 
In 2010 and 2011, earthquakes destroyed many of the historic centre's stone-built buildings.
