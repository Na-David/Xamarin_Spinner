Wellington

Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, sits near the North Island’s southernmost point on the Cook Strait. 
A compact city, it encompasses a waterfront promenade, sandy beaches, a working harbour and colourful timber houses on surrounding hills. 
From Lambton Quay, the iconic red Wellington Cable Car heads to the Wellington Botanic Gardens. 
Strong winds through the Cook Strait give it the nickname "Windy Wellington."
